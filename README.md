# Neural Progenitor Cells for Spinal Cord Injury

## Cytokine and chemokine expression in the spinal cord

**Aim:** This part of the project aims at identifying how transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPCs) affect the inflammatory response following spinal cord injury (SCI).

**Study design:** Animals received a 200 kdyn SCI and transplantation of GFP+NPCs 8-10 days post SCI. Animals were sacrificed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected at 2, 5 and 12 weeks post SCI.

**Material and Methods:** Gene expression of cytokines and chemokines was measured in the spinal cord using RTqPCR.
